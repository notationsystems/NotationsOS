# Payload OS · Notation Systems

Notation Systems is an information manufacturer. It turns heterogeneous source material into governed, point-in-time, computable corpus releases; products and infrastructure distribute and execute against those releases. The corpus and its API are the product; the API, feed, report, agent or workbench is the distribution mechanism for a certified corpus release. Customers apply their own inference, models, agents and workflows to the stream.

This repository holds the product surface over a demonstration corpus and one optional application layer above it. The product surface: certified corpus releases with their build records, production records, release manifests, sources and intelligence-rights schedules; records with value, unit, basis, machine-readable uncertainty and validity bounds, both clocks, provenance, evidence class and stable identity; as-of answers that reconstruct what was knowable at a knowledge time; push retractions; and a fixture-backed feed API under `/api/v1`. The application layer: the Payload OS ruling workbench for the Caravan domain product. Where a customer wants a prescribed control, it turns a claim, a declared use, a tolerance, a valid time, a knowledge-time cutoff and evidence into an inspectable ruling (`ADMITTED`, `ADMITTED_WITH_CONDITIONS`, `PENDING_EVIDENCE`, `REFUSED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `REVOKED`) and makes every part of that ruling inspectable. It is not required for the corpus to be valuable, and it is not a fourth public API. Positioning is set in `docs/ECONOMIC_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

This repository is fixture only. It computes no fact and adjudicates nothing; the `/api/v1` endpoints serve the committed demonstration corpus and every response says `fixture_only: true`. Every fixture-backed screen says so.

## Run

```
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000 → /cases
npm run build && npm start
```

## Check

```
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint           # eslint
npm test               # vitest: node tests for selectors/fixtures, jsdom tests for screens
npm run stamp:digests  # recompute committed sha256 digests after editing a fixture
npm run e2e            # playwright: smoke, axe (WCAG 2.2 AA), keyboard, mobile
npm run screenshots    # writes docs/screenshots/*.png
```

Playwright uses the environment's Chromium when `PW_CHROMIUM_PATH` is set (for example `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium`); otherwise its own download.

## Read

- `docs/ECONOMIC_ARCHITECTURE.md` — authoritative positioning: the information manufacturer, two operating businesses, a separately governed principal-capital activity, and how this repository reflects each.
- `docs/PHASE0_RECON.md` — what the sibling repositories contain, verbatim vocabulary, conflicts, recorded ambiguities.
- `docs/COMPANY_MANDATE.md` — the company mandate, customer categories, economic architecture, and Payload OS product structure.
- `docs/UX_ARCHITECTURE.md` — object model, navigation, projections, component boundaries, the authority boundary.
- `docs/INTERACTION_SPEC.md` — status transitions, refusal interaction, replay, supersession, visibility.
- `docs/DEMO_CASE.md` — the fixtures, why they are synthetic, what they demonstrate, what is unvalidated.

## Layout

```
src/domain      corpus types and as-of selectors (corpus.ts); the operating model as data (product.ts); workbench view model and selectors; domains
src/adapter     CorpusSource and CaseSource seams; feed payload builders; fixture implementations only
src/data-os     compatibility contracts for Bench-derived source-use policy and immutable-evidence capture; not a second corpus or customer API
src/fixtures    Caravan corpus releases, records, retractions and rights; profile and cases; manifest builder; digest plan; committed digests
src/components  primitives, case workspace, ruling viewer, replay, queue, intake, shell
src/app         product model: /product
                corpus: /releases, /releases/[releaseId], /stream, /retractions, /api, /api/v1/* (fixture feed)
                workbench: /cases, /cases/new, /cases/[caseId], /rulings, /rulings/[rulingId], /replay/[caseId], /profiles, /evidence
tests/e2e       Playwright smoke, accessibility, keyboard, mobile, screenshots
